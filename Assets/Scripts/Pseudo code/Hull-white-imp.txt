1. Initialize Parameters:
   - Set initial interest rate (e.g., current market rate) -> InitialRate
   - Set model parameters:
      - Mean Reversion (mean reversion speed) -> MeanReversion
      - Volatility (volatility of interest rates) -> Volatility
      - Time step size (duration of each time step) -> dt
      - Simulation time horizon (total duration of simulation) -> TimeHorizon

2. Generate Random Shocks:
   - Generate random shocks for each time step based on a normal distribution
   - These shocks will represent the randomness in interest rate movements

3. Initialize Bond Prices:
   - Set initial bond prices based on current interest rate and bond characteristics
   - Bond characteristics may include:
      - Face value of the bond
      - Coupon rate
      - Maturity date
      - Yield-to-maturity (initial yield)

4. Loop over Time Steps:
   for each time step t from 1 to simulation time horizon:
       4.1. Calculate Drift:
            - Use the Hull-White model equations to calculate the drift in interest rates
            - Drift = MeanReversion * (Long-TermRate - CurrentRate) * dt
            - Mean reversion represents the tendency of interest rates to move towards a long-term equilibrium rate.
            - It determines how quickly interest rates revert to the long-term rate.
       4.2. Calculate Diffusion:
            - Use the Hull-White model equations to calculate the diffusion term
            - Diffusion = Volatility * sqrt(dt) * Z
            - Volatility represents the magnitude of random fluctuations in interest rates.
            - Z is a random number drawn from a standard normal distribution
       4.3. Update Interest Rates:
            - Update the interest rate for the current time step using the drift and diffusion terms
            - NewRate = CurrentRate + Drift + Diffusion
       4.4. Update Bond Prices:
            - Update bond prices based on the new interest rate and bond characteristics
            - Use bond pricing formulas like present value calculations
            - Bond prices are affected by changes in interest rates, coupon payments, and time to maturity.
       4.5. Store Results:
            - Store the interest rate and bond prices for the current time step

5. Simulation Complete:
   - Use the stored interest rates and bond prices to analyze the bond market evolution
   - You can calculate various metrics such as yield curves, bond durations, etc.

6. End of Simulation:
   - End the simulation and display or use the results in your game as needed
